Add themed environments and bonus coin power-ups to the game

Introduce new game themes (Halloween, Christmas) with unique visual styles, lighting, and environments, along with power-ups for coin multipliers and extra lives. Implement theme selection and purchase logic in the shop, update environment generation for theme-specific decorations, and adjust trash obstacle rendering based on the active theme. Modify lighting components to use theme-based settings and update coin reward calculations to incorporate active coin multipliers.
